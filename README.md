# BVH

This project was created as our Data Structures 2 project for Habib universiy. Myself and my partners have decided to implement Bounding Volume Heirarchies(BVH) to display in our project.

The best and easiest way to know what BVH is that it is a data structure used in commonly in computer graphics , collision detection, and ray tracing.  

BVH is an efficient spatial partitioning method that organizes objects in a tree structure, facilitating fast intersection tests and efficient rendering.

# Features: 

Implementation of BVH construction algorithm

Converts any meshes into much simplified cubes at each layer.

How to use:
Run main.py filepath outpath

# Next Steps:

Implement this algorithm into a ray tracing simulation to test efficiency
